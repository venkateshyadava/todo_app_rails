# Run migrations
rails db:migrate

# Seed with sample data (optional)
rails db:seed

# Reset database (if needed)
rails db:reset
```

## Testing

Run the test suite to ensure everything is working correctly:

```bash
# Run all tests
rails test

# Run specific test files
rails test test/models/
rails test test/controllers/
rails test test/system/

# Run tests with coverage
COVERAGE=true rails test
```

## Development

### Development Workflow

1. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   rails server
   ```

2. **Run tests before committing**
   ```bash
   rails test
   ```

3. **Check code style**
   ```bash
   bin/rubocop
   ```

4. **Update dependencies**
   ```bash
   bundle update
   yarn upgrade
   ```

### Code Quality

- Follow Ruby style guidelines
- Write tests for new features
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Keep the codebase clean and well-documented

### Debugging

- Use `rails console` for interactive debugging
- Check logs in `log/development.log`

docker run -p 3000:3000 todo-app
```

### Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Set up environment variables
2. Configure your database (PostgreSQL recommended)
3. Set up asset compilation
4. Configure your web server (Nginx/Apache)
5. Set up SSL certificates

## API Documentation
